# jQuery_panelSlider
A simple panel slider widget for jQuery UI

# Usage of panelSlider
For now the panelSlider only works with id tags (not class tags). This is quite simple to change, but I would like to an actual usage of classes before altering the widget.


Look into index.html for a specific example. It's quite simple

#Current issues
The widget works as intended. The only issue is that it seems that the list of panels is not really used, and therefore any DOM object can essentially be used as a panel.
